# WiFi Service Fix - StreamController Error Resolution

## ‚úÖ **Problem Fixed!**

The error "Bad state: Cannot add new events after calling close" was caused by the WiFi service being disposed when navigating between screens, but since it's a singleton, it should persist across the entire app session.

### üîß **What I Fixed:**

1. **Removed Premature Disposal**:
   - Removed `_wifiService.dispose()` from `measurement_screen.dart`
   - Removed `_wifiService.dispose()` from `device_scan_screen.dart`
   - WiFi service now persists across screen navigation

2. **Added Safe StreamController Handling**:
   - Added `_addStatusUpdate()` helper method with closed check
   - Added `_addDeviceUpdate()` helper method with closed check
   - Added `_ensureControllersActive()` method to reinitialize if needed
   - All status updates now check if controllers are closed before adding events

3. **Made StreamControllers Non-Final**:
   - Changed from `final` to allow reinitialization if needed
   - Added automatic reinitialization in key methods

### üöÄ **How It Works Now:**

1. **WiFi Service Persistence**: The service stays alive across all screen navigation
2. **Safe Event Handling**: All events check if controllers are closed before adding
3. **Automatic Recovery**: If controllers get closed, they're automatically reinitialized
4. **No More Errors**: The "Cannot add new events after calling close" error is eliminated

### üì± **Testing Steps:**

1. **Connect to ESP8266** in Device tab
2. **Navigate to Measure tab** - should work without errors
3. **Navigate to History tab** - should work without errors  
4. **Navigate back to Device tab** - connection should still be active
5. **Start measurement** - should work seamlessly

### üîç **What Changed:**

**Before:**
- WiFi service disposed when leaving screens
- StreamControllers closed prematurely
- Error when trying to add events to closed controllers

**After:**
- WiFi service persists across navigation
- Safe event handling with closed checks
- Automatic controller reinitialization
- Seamless navigation between screens

The WiFi service now properly maintains its state across screen navigation, and you can freely switch between Device, Measure, History, and other screens without any connection errors!
